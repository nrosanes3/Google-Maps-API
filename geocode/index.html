                    <h2>Nina Explores Madrid!</h2>
                    <p>Full of energy and packed with cultural attractions, Madrid is a modern metropolis that offers a taste of the real Spain. Wide avenues are congested with traffic, but beautiful parks break up the urban sprawl.</p>
                    <p>Madrid doesn't have the traditional charm of Andalusia or the beauty of Barcelona, instead, it is a hub of social life with a happening café culture and bustling nightlife. The city is constantly buzzing with activity and there are so many things to see and do that tourists will be spoiled for choice.</p>
                    <p>Spain's capital city, Madrid boasts an impressive array of historical monuments and art museums, as well as pleasant gardens and public plazas. Take a look at some of the places Nina has explored!</p>

The Palacio de Cristal, in the shape of a Greek cross, is made almost entirely of glass set in an iron framework on a brick base, which is decorated with ceramics. The cast-iron frame was manufactured in Bilbao.[2] The structure was designed in a way that would allow it to be re-erected on another site (as happened to the equivalent building in London). However, the building has remained on the original site, next to a lake, and has been restored to its original appearance. It is no longer used as a greenhouse, and is currently used for art exhibits.</p>"
